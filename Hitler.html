			Surely, we all know Hitler and what he did. He is considered one of the most bloody ruler of all time, compared to <a href = "
			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler">Vlad III</a> and many more. But what the most of people don't know is Hitler actually wanted to be in faculty of fine arts and be a painter, but he was rejected twice, the director suggested he should apply to the school of Architecture, but he lacked the necessary academic credentials because he had not finished secondary school.
		</p>
		<p>
			And here comes our first "What if?" question. What if Hitler actually got accepted in faculty of fine arts:
			<ol id = "list">
				<li>Millions of jews won't be murdered and killed.</li>
				<li>By consequences, jews will be all around the world. There won't be a country with no jews in it.</li>
				<li>Hitler might be a famous painter and known by almost everyone, specially the ones who are to be killed by his hands.</li>
			</ol>
